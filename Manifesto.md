Datasketch Store is an impact design store that seeks to democratize access to knowledge and inform citizens about critical issues of public debate in our society. Our products use open technologies that make it possible to visualize social problems, such as gender equality, the fight against corruption, human rights and the environment.

We are a multidisciplinary, diverse, creative and feminist team, aware that the use of data and visualizations are an effective instrument to activate citizenship and disseminate messages that allow us to make better decisions as a society.

We are driven by fashion and design as an innovative element that brings together the economic, social and cultural aspects in a single space to question our perceptions, habits and attitudes of our everyday life. Fashion can go beyond appearances or stereotypes and is an effective vehicle to reconfigure our social system and cultural identity.

We create our products to:


Defend the public. We seek citizens to appropriate public resources -including access to information- and promote responsible use of them.


Promote an open society: We want to create a transparent, supportive and generous society with knowledge, where the opening of information serves to promote partnerships and collaborative work.

Defend life We trust in the power of people to improve their environment; life is sacred and any act that attempts against it is a loss of a potential for change.

Strengthen democracy We believe that only with spaces for dialogue, discussion and negotiation can we guarantee inclusive policies and the effective enjoyment of our rights without any type of censorship or violation of freedoms.


Promote respect. We seek to eliminate the use of violence and incorporate new cultural practices to build a just, pluralistic, inclusive, diverse and peaceful society.

Fight for gender equality. We believe in the construction of a just society with a gender perspective and we want to reconfigure the centralization of power with new forms of participation.

Be inclusive We work to make visible the struggles of stigmatized groups to build a society with equal opportunities that does not discriminate by race, gender or condition.

Defend the environment We seek to raise awareness about the environmental impact of human beings and promote ecological practices that value all forms of life.
